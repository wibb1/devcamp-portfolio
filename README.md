# My Portfolio

This app was part of a deeper dive into the Ruby on Rails playground.  After Launch Academy I wanted to learn more about how to structure a Ruby on Rails app, so I found an Udemy course that would help me learn more.  The course I found was called "Dissecting Ruby on Rails 5 - Become a Professional Developer" from Jordan Hudgens, CTO at Bottega Code School.  

I really enjoyed the course, the different technologies used really kept me on my toes, and I learned a lot.  The best part was definitely gaining a better understanding of when and how to split up code and where to put the code in the various folders.  We used concerns, helpers, jobs, channels and moving code to the model to dry up the controller code.

This app is the basis of that course, although I have put several of my own tweeks on it.  This app will also serve as my portfolio for other projects that I have completed, a space to put some of the gist/instructions that I have put together, and a place to put notes on the things I learn along the way.  You can also see an online version of my resume and learn a little bit about me.  Finally the pictures on the site are my own, I will try to change these up from time to time as well to keep it interesting.
