  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Attempting a career change after working for 20 years is not an easy decision. I developed a great career in the environmental field; mainly helping energy and industrial clients or employers to comply with environmental regulations. I led large cross functional engineering teams to develop large projects and participated in small in-house teams that made great strides in cost control through optimization. I designed complete environmental recordkeeping systems to ensure compliance with permitting requirements at multiple facilities. I worked with engineers to maintain or expand production capacity while assuring compliance with environmental laws. In addition, I have managed internal and external clients, ensuring projects are on time and on budget.</p>

  <p>However, over the last 10 years the expatriation of manufacturing facilities has accelerated and the shift toward renewable energy generation technologies has made my skills in the environmental field less in demand. This is why I have chosen a new career. As part of that decision I joined Launch Academy, an imersive web developer training program </p>

  <p>During my time at Launch Academy, I built my knowledge of Ruby on Rails and JavaScript and further developed my knowledge of relational databases. The philosophies that Launch Academy has taught me are well aligned with the way one builds software. At Launch I learned full stack development in a program originally designed as a 70-80 hour per week onsite learning academy; however with the advent of COVID-19 we were forced to complete the program remotely. This has prepared me well for the current remote working conditions, and I have continued my learning using online tools.</p>

  <p>I welcome the challenges that will come with my career change. I understand that I am taking on a new and different occupation and look forward to building another great career over the next 20 years.
